# ambiPy ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

## Description
ambiPy is a low budget Philips Ambilight clone for *WS2812b Leds + RPi4* setup. System is based on Python script running on Raspberry Pi 4b with connected HDMI of the display. You can find my previous 'Ambilight clone' project [here](https://github.com/alehee/AmbiLed).

## Used technology
* Python3
* Raspberry Pi 4b

## Libraries
* [JSON](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/read-json-file-using-python)
* [rpi-ws281x](https://github.com/rpi-ws281x/rpi-ws281x-python/blob/master/examples/strandtest.py)
* [OpenCV](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-capture-a-image-from-webcam-in-python/)
* [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
* numpy

## Prerequisites
To run the whole system you need some things. Here is a list with required hardware to even start thinking about testing the software:
* **Raspberry Pi 4b** *(or lower version, but didn't tested on others)*
* **WS2812B Leds with adapter** [here's](https://www.temposlighting.com/guides/power-any-ws2812b-setup) a link with led strip powering instructions
* **HDMI to USB conventer** [here's](https://ecsmedia.pl/c/retoo-konwerter-video-z-hdmi-do-usb-grabber-adapter-b-iext104960224.jpg) an example, it converts HDMI input to the USB camera input
* **basic soldering skills** to connect the leds and prepare it at the back of your display

## Software
If you are already stocked with required hardware you can prepare the software!

  ### Download and Installation
  There's two ways: you can download the master branch with code and check how it's working, or simply download it from link below and run it with python environment
  
  #### Version 0.1.0.0
  Still working on it, but it's happening!
  
  #### What next?
  If the program runs with no problems you are good to go! Software preparation will be continued in *How To Use* section so [hop in](#how-to-use) if you want!

## Hardware
Here I will show you how to prepare all of the needed hardware.

  ### Raspberry Pi preparation

  Beep.
  
  ### Leds preparation
  
  Boop.

## How To Use
We still have some preparations to make, so here's the last steps.

  ### Configuration
  
  Beedop.
  
  ### Launching
  
  Boooooop. Working on it!

## Changelog
What's new? Here's the list:

* **0.1.0.0** - *in progress*
  * basics
